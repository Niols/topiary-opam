Rather than using this crate directly, use the
[`malachite`](https://crates.io/crates/malachite) meta-crate. It re-exports all of this crate's
public members.

In `malachite-float`'s doctests you will frequently see import paths beginning with
`malachite_float::`. When using the `malachite` crate, replace this part of the paths with
`malachite::`.

The import path of the `Float` type is shortened to `malachite::Float`.

# malachite-float
This crate defines
[`Float`](https://docs.rs/malachite-float/latest/malachite_float/struct.Float.html)s.
